types:

1) ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable
from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType.

2) NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP service,
to which the NodePort service will route, is automatically created. You’ll be able to contact the NodePort service,
from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.

Example:
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=NodePort --name=example-service

If you set the type field to "NodePort", the Kubernetes master will allocate a port from a flag-configured
range (default: 30000-32767), and each Node will proxy that port (the same port number on every Node) into your Service.
That port will be reported in your Service’s spec.ports[*].nodePort field.

If you want a specific port number, you can specify a value in the nodePort field,
and the system will allocate you that port or else the API transaction will fail
(i.e. you need to take care about possible port collisions yourself).
The value you specify must be in the configured range for node ports.

Note that this Service will be visible as both <NodeIP>:spec.ports[*].nodePort and spec.clusterIp:spec.ports[*].port.
